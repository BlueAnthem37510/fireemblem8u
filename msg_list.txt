Red units are the enemy\x1F\x01units the player must defeat.\x1F\x01Red units will attack both blue\x1F\x01and green units, so be careful.\x1F"
MSG_060E "Units take turns moving in\x01the following order:\x01    1. Player (blue)\x01    2. Enemy (red)\x01    3. Neutral (green)"
MSG_060F "If a main character's Hit Points\x01are reduced to zero, the game\x1F\x01ends.\x1F"
MSG_0610 "The blue area that appears\x01when you select a unit is\x1F\x01its movement range. Place the\x1F\x01cursor on an enemy unit to see\x01its movement range.\x1F"
MSG_0611 "Mounted units can move again\x01after visiting homes or villages\x01if they have movement remaining.\x01This is most common among\x1F\x01cavaliers and pegasus knights."
MSG_0612 "The red area that appears when\x01you select a unit is its\x01attack range. Place the cursor\x01on an enemy unit to see its\x1F\x01attack range.\x1F"
MSG_0613 "Each weapon type has its own\x01strengths and weaknesses.\x1F\x01Swords do well against axes.\x01Axes do well against lances.\x01Lances do well against swords.\x01This is called the\x01Weapon Triangle."
MSG_0614 "Each type of magic has its own\x01strengths and weaknesses.\x1F\x01Light is strong against Dark.\x1F\x01Dark is strong against Anima.\x1F\x01Anima is strong against Light.\x01This is called the\x01Trinity of Magic.\x1F"
MSG_0615 "Some weapons are especially\x1F\x01effective against certain units.\x01These weapons will cause heavy\x01damage to those units. For\x01example, bows are particularly\x01effective against flying units.\x1F\x01The weapon icons in the combat\x01information window will glow\x01when your unit is facing an\x1F\x01enemy that is weak against\x01that weapon."
MSG_0616 "Critical hits inflict three times\x1F\x01the normal damage to enemies.\x1F\x01Your chance of a critical strike\x01changes depending on your unit's\x01attributes and the weapon with\x01which you are attacking."
MSG_0617 "Any attack from a weapon is a\x1F\x01physical attack. Each unit's\x01DEF (defense) attribute\x1F\x01shows how well he defends\x1F\x01against physical attacks. The\x1F\x01higher the number, the less\x1F\x01damage he takes. Knights and\x01mercenaries have good defense."
MSG_0618 "Any attack with magic is called\x1F\x01a magical attack. Your unit's\x1F\x01RES (resistance) attribute\x01shows how well he defends\x1F\x01against them. The higher the\x01number, the less damage he\x01takes. Mages, monks, clerics\x01& shamans have high resistance.\x1F"
MSG_0619 "Restore HP to your units by using\x1F\x01vulneraries, elixirs, and staves.\x1F\x01Vulneraries and elixirs heal\x01only the user, while staves heal\x01only the units on whom they're\x01used. Choose your healing\x1F\x01items carefully in battle."
MSG_061A "There are five abnormal states\x01a unit can enter:\x1F\x011. Sleep\x01(Asleep and unable to move)\x1F\x012. Silence\x01(Unable to use magic or staves)\x1F\x013. Poison\x1F\x01(Take continual damage)\x1F\x014. Berserk\x01(Attack enemies and allies alike)\x1F\x015. Petrify\x01(Turned to stone, cannot move)\x01These conditions will continue for\x01several turns. They can be\x01reversed with a Restore staff."
MSG_061B "Here is the information shown if\x01you choose the strategic\x01combat information window:\x01\x01HP: Unit's remaining HP.\x01MT: Amount of damage the\x01equipped weapon inflicts.\x1F\x01HIT: Chance an attack will land.\x01CRIT: Chance the weapon will\x01land a critical blow.\x1F"
MSG_061C "Here is the information shown if\x01you choose the detailed\x1F\x01combat information window:\x01\x01HP: Unit's remaining HP.\x01ATK: Amount of damage your\x01attack will inflict.\x01DEF: Amount of damage enemy\x1F\x01attacks will be reduced by.\x1F\x01HIT: Chance an attack will land.\x01CRIT: Chance the weapon will land\x1F\x01a critical blow.\x01AS: The speed of each unit's\x01attack, which determines how\x01many attacks each unit makes.\x1F"
MSG_061D "Any unit can rescue a blue or\x1F\x01green unit in an adjacent tile.\x1F\x01However, your constitution must\x1F\x01be higher than that of the unit\x1F\x01you're trying to rescue.\x01The rescuing unit suffers a\x1F\x01penalty in speed and skill,\x1F\x01but the rescued unit is\x1F\x01protected from attacks.\x1F\x01If a unit is about to lose all\x01of its HP, use the rescue\x1F\x01command to whisk it to safety."
MSG_061E "You can drop a rescued unit into\x01any adjacent tile. The dropped\x01unit will not be able to move\x1F\x01until the next turn."
MSG_061F "You can purchase items at\x1F\x01shops. You can also pick them\x1F\x01up by visiting villagers and\x01opening chests. Enemies\x1F\x01sometimes drop items when\x1F\x01they are defeated."
MSG_0620 "Choose an item from the item\x01list and press the A Button\x1F\x01to use it. Items that cannot\x01be used by that unit will be\x01grayed out.\x1F"
MSG_0621 "You can trade items with units\x01in adjacent tiles. Select Trade\x1F\x01on the command menu, and then\x1F\x01select the unit with whom you\x1F\x01want to trade. Next, place the\x01cursor on the item you want to\x01take from the other unit's\x01inventory and press the A Button\x01to receive that item.\x1F"
MSG_0622 "Items have a limited number of\x01uses. Each time you use an item\x1F\x01its durability goes down. The\x1F\x01number next to an item indicates\x01how many times it can be used.\x01When that number reaches 0, the\x1F\x01item breaks and disappears.\x1F\x01Be careful not to let items drop\x01to 0 in the heat of battle.\x1F"
MSG_0623 "A supply convoy travels with\x01your main character. If you\x1F\x01move to a space adjacent your\x1F\x01supply convoy, you can trade\x01items with it. On the battle\x01preparation screen, you can\x1F\x01also buy and sell items at the\x01supply convoy. The convoy can\x1F\x01store up to 100 items for you."
MSG_0624 "Move a unit onto an armory and\x01then choose Armory to buy\x1F\x01weapons. You can also sell\x01items you've collected here."
MSG_0625 "Move a unit onto a shop and\x1F\x01then choose Shop to buy and\x1F\x01sell items, magic tomes, and\x01staves.\x1F"
MSG_0626 "Forests and mountains give\x01units additional cover. When\x01your units are in these tiles,\x01enemy hit percentages will be\x1F\x01reduced. When entering attack\x1F\x01range, try to stop in one of\x01these spaces.\x1F"
MSG_0627 "Any unit that ends its turn\x1F\x01on a fortress, castle gate,\x1F\x01gate, or throne will regain\x1F\x01some HP automatically at the\x01beginning of the next turn.\x1F"
MSG_0628 "Move a unit to a house to visit\x1F\x01the occupants of that house.\x01This is a good way of gaining\x1F\x01useful information that might\x1F\x01turn the battle in your favor.\x01Visit houses whenever you get\x1F\x01the opportunity."
MSG_0629 "Move a unit to a village to\x1F\x01speak with its villagers.\x1F\x01You can gain information,\x1F\x01items, and even money from\x01villages, so visit them if\x01you have the opportunity.\x1F"
MSG_062A "Move units onto spaces with\x1F\x01chests to open them. Chests\x1F\x01are filled with all sorts of\x01useful items. However, you'll\x1F\x01need a chest key or lockpicks\x1F\x01to open the chest."
MSG_062B "If you see an old snag near\x1F\x01a river, knock it over to\x1F\x01form an impromptu bridge.\x1F"
MSG_062C "Attack cracked walls to\x1F\x01destroy them and create\x1F\x01new paths."
MSG_062D "Darkness and fog limit your\x1F\x01field of vision, preventing\x1F\x01you from seeing distant enemies.\x01Use thieves, torches, and\x1F\x01Torch staves to increase your\x1F\x01field of vision."
MSG_062E "These siege weapons\x1F\x01fire missiles from long\x1F\x01distances. Place an archer or\x1F\x01sniper on them to use them.\x1F"
MSG_062F "On your quest, you will run\x1F\x01across many characters who\x01might join your cause. Watch\x01story hints carefully to find\x1F\x01who should talk to these\x01characters and convince them\x01to join you."
MSG_0630 "Except in rare cases, if one of\x1F\x01your units loses all of its HP,\x1F\x01it will retreat from battle and be\x01unable to fight again. Be careful!"
MSG_0631 "Some units have special bonds\x1F\x01between them. The longer they\x1F\x01spend in adjoining spaces, the\x01stronger that bond will grow.\x1F\x01Once this bond is strong enough,\x01the Support command will appear\x1F\x01on the command menu.\x01Select it to make the characters\x01share a support conversation.\x1F"
MSG_0632 "If supportive units are within\x01three spaces of each other they\x1F\x01both gain special combat\x01bonuses. There are three levels\x1F\x01of support. The higher the level,\x1F\x01the better the bonuses received.\x01Support levels increase each\x01time units share a conversation."
MSG_0633 "Green units are neutral. They\x1F\x01may become allies if you speak\x01to them. If you move to a space\x1F\x01adjacent to a green unit, the\x1F\x01Talk command may appear.\x01Choose \x93Talk\x94 to convince the\x1F\x01unit to join you.\x1F"
MSG_0634 "Some enemy units will join you\x01if you talk to them. Move a\x1F\x01character you think might know\x01that enemy unit into a space\x01adjacent to it to see if they\x1F\x01can talk.\x1F\x01Be careful! Enemy units will\x01continue to attack until you\x01talk to them! Try not to take\x1F\x01them out or be taken out before\x1F\x01you have a chance to chat."
MSG_0635 "If you defeat the enemy boss,\x1F\x01you clear the map. There is no\x01need to defeat all enemy units.\x1F"
MSG_0636 "Move the main character onto a\x01throne, castle gate, gate, or\x1F\x01other such location and choose\x01Seize from the command menu\x1F\x01to clear the map.\x1F"
MSG_0637 "Clear the map by wiping out\x1F\x01all enemy units."
MSG_0638 "Hold out against the enemy for\x01a set number of turns to clear\x01the map."
MSG_0639 "Choose Suspend on the command\x1F\x01menu to save your game during\x1F\x01a battle. The next time you\x1F\x01play, choose Resume to continue\x1F\x01playing where you left off.\x1F"

MSG_063B "Place the cursor on a space\x1F\x01and press the A Button to\x1F\x01move to that location."
MSG_063C "Some areas on the world map\x1F\x01contain stores. You can see\x1F\x01where stores are located by\x1F\x01placing the cursor on a location\x01and viewing the shop icons that\x1F\x01appear next to the place name.\x01You can enter any of these\x01stores if the main character\x01is at that location."
MSG_063D "Manage your units' items by\x1F\x01placing the cursor on the\x1F\x01main character and pressing\x1F\x01the A Button.\x1F"
MSG_063E "Sometimes, creatures will appear\x01on an area you've already\x1F\x01cleared. To drive off the\x1F\x01monsters, move to that area\x1F\x01and battle the fiends."
MSG_063F "Ready your units for battle\x1F\x01before entering the battlefield.\x01Choose which units will fight,\x01and manage the weapons and\x01items they will use in the battle.\x01Press START to begin combat."
MSG_0640 "Units gain EXP (experience\x01points) by fighting and by using\x01staves. They go up a level when\x1F\x01they earn 100 EXP. As they go\x1F\x01up in level, characters become\x01stronger, more skilled, etc.\x01The highest level is level 20."
MSG_0641 "Most units can change classes\x1F\x01once they reach level 10.\x1F\x01Changing classes dramatically\x1F\x01improves a unit's abilities.\x01If you're in a tough battle, be\x1F\x01sure to change classes. When\x01changing classes, you will be able\x01to choose between 2 classes.\x01Look at the overall party\x1F\x01makeup before deciding!\x1F"
MSG_0642 "If there's a command you're\x1F\x01unfamiliar with, place the cursor\x1F\x01over it and press the R Button.\x1F\x01This will bring up a simple\x1F\x01explanation of the command.\x1F"
MSG_0643 "Visit an arena, and bet your\x01money and your life on single\x1F\x01combat. Move a unit onto an\x1F\x01arena and choose Arena from\x1F\x01the command menu to enter.\x01If you win a battle, you'll\x1F\x01win twice what you wagered.\x1F\x01If you lose, that unit will\x1F\x01be gone for good.\x1F"
MSG_0644 "You can escape from battles\x1F\x01in towers, in ruins, or with\x01monsters. On the command menu,\x01select Retreat to withdraw\x01from combat in any of these\x1F\x01locations."

MSG_07FF "Marisa, the Crimson Flash\x1F"
MSG_0800 "Marisa became battalion leader for an\x1F\x01elite mercenary force. Many men sought\x01to challenge her to a duel, and none\x01of them stood up to her blade."
MSG_0801 "Saleh, the Well of Wisdom\x1F"
MSG_0802 "Saleh returned to Caer Pelyn, where he\x01remained a faithful servant of the Manakete.\x01His days were not spent in isolation, though.\x1F\x01Many of the friends he met during the War of\x01the Stones came to visit his village.\x1F"
MSG_0803 "Ewan, Enthusiastic Student"
MSG_0804 "Ewan continued his studies, modeling\x01his life after the teachings of Saleh.\x01Eventually, his education branched off into\x1F\x01different paths. His insatiable curiosity\x1F\x01led him on a trip to explore the world.\x1F"
MSG_0805 "L'Arachel, Queen of Light\x1F"
MSG_0806 "She succeeded her uncle as ruler of the\x1F\x01Rausten Theocracy several years after\x1F\x01the war ended. She never lost her...unique\x01perspective on life. She spent much of her\x01rule visiting the neighboring countries."
MSG_0807 "Dozla of the Steady Axe\x1F"
MSG_0808 "As L'Arachel rose to become queen, he\x1F\x01remained by her side. Watching L'Arachel\x01grow to become the queen she was destined to\x01be was Dozla's greatest joy in life."
MSG_0809 "Rennac, Rich \x93Merchant\x94\x1F"
MSG_080A "L'Arachel summoned Rennac back to Rausten,\x01and he was forced to return. He was never\x1F\x01able to escape his service to the self-\x1F\x01centered princess who became queen.\x1F\x01Admittedly, he didn't try very hard."
MSG_080B "Duessel, Obsidian General\x1F"
MSG_080C "Following the war, Duessel returned to Grado,\x1F\x01where he was instrumental in its rebuilding.\x01He spent his remaining years watching over\x01Grado and sharing his wisdom with other\x1F\x01nations as an expert combat instructor.\x1F"
MSG_080D "Myrrh, the Great Dragon\x1F"
MSG_080E "After bidding her farewells to Ephraim,\x1F\x01she returned to Darkling Woods. She lived\x1F\x01a long and full life, served by the people\x01of Caer Pelyn and comforted by the memories\x1F\x01of her dear friends."
MSG_080F "Knoll, Watcher of Darkness"
MSG_0810 "Knoll returned to Grado, where he dedicated\x1F\x01himself to rebuilding it and fulfilling\x1F\x01Lyon's vision. When the country was restored\x01to its former glory, he disappeared without\x1F\x01a trace, never to be seen again."
MSG_0811 "Joshua, the Tempest King"
MSG_0812 "Joshua returned to Jehanna and ruled over\x1F\x01it as king. His skills as a leader had\x01grown great, and Jehanna flourished as\x01never before. He never outgrew his love\x1F\x01of travel and games of chance."
MSG_0813 "Graceful Syrene\x1F"
MSG_0814 "Syrene continued as commander of Frelia's\x1F\x01pegasus knights. Her grace and beauty in\x01flight were the subject of many songs\x1F\x01and paintings, and her popularity soared.\x1F"
MSG_0815 "Tana, Winged Queen"
MSG_0816 "Tana lived happily in the prosperous post-\x01war Frelia. She flew to Renais often to\x1F\x01visit her dear friend Eirika.\x1F"
MSG_0817 "Busy days awaited Eirika and Ephraim as they\x01struggled to rebuild Renais. Their work gave\x01new hope to those ravaged by the war, and\x1F\x01with Eirika's constant help, Ephraim grew to\x01be a trusted and honorable king."
MSG_0818 "Upon their return to Renais, Eirika and Seth\x01were wed, with the blessings of Ephraim and all\x1F\x01of the Knights of Renais. The tale of the love\x01that grew between a princess and her loyal\x01knight became a beloved romance in Renais."
MSG_0819 "After the war, Eirika and Saleh returned to their\x1F\x01respective homes. Eirika visited Caer Pelyn\x1F\x01when she could. Eventually, she left Renais in\x01the care of her brother and wed Saleh. Their\x01daughter resembles the legendary Nada Kuya.\x1F"
MSG_081A "Following the war, Tana and Eirika remained\x1F\x01the best of friends. They visited one another\x1F\x01when time permitted, and as they grew older,\x01their children shared a bond of friendship\x01as close as Eirika and Tana themselves did.\x1F"
MSG_081B "After the war, Eirika and Forde returned to\x1F\x01Renais. Eirika spent her days toiling in\x01the reconstruction of Renais, and he was her\x01faithful supporter. His portrait of Eirika\x01captured the smile he had thought lost forever.\x1F"
MSG_081C "After the war, Ephraim returned to Renais and\x1F\x01Myrrh to Darkling Woods. They both turned their\x1F\x01attention to their respective duties but never\x01forgot one another. Though Myrrh never again\x01left Darkling Woods, Ephraim often visited her.\x1F"
MSG_081D "Ephraim and L'Arachel each returned home\x01after the war, but L'Arachel visited Renais\x1F\x01often. Over time, the two were wed. Their\x1F\x01marriage threw Rausten into turmoil, but\x01L'Arachel's self-centeredness carried the day."
MSG_081E "Once Renais was stable again, Ephraim and\x1F\x01Tana were wed. Innes protested vocally, but\x1F\x01when he saw how happy Tana was, he gave the\x1F\x01marriage his blessings. Renais and Frelia\x1F\x01are now bound by blood as well as friendship.\x1F"
MSG_081F "Natasha returned to Renais with Seth, where\x1F\x01the two were wed. The reconstruction of Renais\x01kept them busy, but when all the work was\x1F\x01done, they settled down to live their days\x01in peace and happiness.\x1F"
MSG_0820 "Franz brought Amelia home with him to Renais.\x1F\x01Amelia spent a short time in Renais's army,\x1F\x01but once she and Franz were married, she\x01retired her commission. The two had a daughter\x01who grew to be a great knight herself."
MSG_0821 "Gilliam and Syrene returned to Frelia, where they\x1F\x01were married. All agreed they were a perfect\x01match, and their union was blessed by the\x1F\x01crown and the order of knights. The two\x1F\x01continued their unwavering service together."
MSG_0822 "At Innes's request, Vanessa moved into\x01Castle Frelia where she continued her duties\x01as a knight of the realm. Thereafter, they\x01had a child and lived happily with the\x01blessing of all around them."
MSG_0823 "Forde's love for Vanessa grew after the war,\x01and although she loved him as well, she\x1F\x01placed her duty to Frelia first. Undeterred,\x01Forde moved to Frelia himself. Over time,\x1F\x01the two were wed.\x1F"
MSG_0824 "Father and son returned to Ide, where they\x01toiled together to rebuild their village.\x1F\x01Ross grew to become a greater warrior than\x01even his father. When he himself had a son,\x1F\x01that child continued his family's legacy.\x1F"
MSG_0825 "The childhood friends became lovers first,\x01then husband and wife. Worried for Neimi's\x01well-being, Colm gave up his adventurer's ways.\x1F\x01Neimi passed on her grandfather's skill in\x01archery to her own son and daughter."
MSG_0826 "Artur and Lute were married upon their return.\x01Artur handled the housework, but otherwise,\x1F\x01their lives were unchanged. When they had a\x1F\x01son, Lute's interests shifted from studying\x1F\x01Artur to studying her son's baffling habits."
MSG_0827 "After the war, Kyle and Lute were married in\x01Renais. Kyle's friends were disturbed by his\x01choice of brides, but they could not deny\x1F\x01his happiness. Before long, they had a son,\x1F\x01and Kyle dedicated himself to his upbringing.\x1F"
MSG_0828 "When Joshua returned to Jehanna, he took\x01Natasha as his bride and claimed the throne\x1F\x01as its rightful heir. Natasha was the perfect\x1F\x01companion, and together, they carried the\x1F\x01mighty desert nation to great glory."
MSG_0829 "Sometimes, the greatest friends also differ\x1F\x01greatly in personality. When Kyle and Forde\x1F\x01returned home, they were celebrated in song\x1F\x01and story. They lived their days in happiness,\x01as dearest friends and toughest rivals.\x1F"
MSG_082A "Cormag returned to Grado to assist in the\x1F\x01reconstruction of his country. Shortly\x01after, he left to wander on his own. Tana\x1F\x01spent years looking for him. In time, she\x1F\x01found him and knighted him in Frelia's service.\x1F"
MSG_082B "Stories tell of the sparks that flew between\x01L'Arachel and Innes when they first met. As\x1F\x01the love between them flourished, so too did\x01the bond that united their two nations.\x1F"
MSG_082C "Gerik and Tethys remained bound to no nation\x01and beholden to no authority. They bought\x1F\x01themselves a leisurely retirement. Gerik\x01taught fencing to city youths, and Tethys\x1F\x01found many stages on which to dance."
MSG_082D "Gerik remained a mercenary, and Marisa\x01became his company's fencing instructor.\x01Gerik returned the affection she gave\x1F\x01him, although he was troubled to learn she\x01was clumsy at everything but fighting."
MSG_082E "Myrrh returned to Darkling Woods, but at\x01Saleh's request, she eventually moved to Caer\x1F\x01Pelyn. In time, the townsfolk learned to\x01treat her not as the Great Dragon but\x1F\x01rather as a normal girl, and she was happy.\x1F"
MSG_082F "Master and student returned to Caer Pelyn to\x01study in peace. Ewan worked hard, and in time,\x01his power grew to rival Saleh's. As equals,\x1F\x01the two continued their studies together and\x01expanded their knowledge ever more.\x1F"
MSG_0830 "Joshua returned to Jehanna with Marisa, where\x1F\x01she pledged service to the crown and became\x1F\x01the top swordfighter in the land. Joshua still\x01loved games of chance, but when it came to\x01Marisa, she was ever the winner."
MSG_0831 "L'Arachel was, in time, made queen of Rausten,\x01with Dozla at her side, as always. Later, Dozla\x1F\x01wept like a baby when L'Arachel was wed. His\x01emotional outburst is remembered as much as,\x01if not more than, the ceremony itself."
MSG_0832 "Amelia traveled to Ross's hometown, where she\x1F\x01decided to remain. Over time, the two fell in\x1F\x01love and were wed. Years later they had a son\x1F\x01who grew into a warrior. As he grew in skill\x01and strength, he surpassed even his father.\x1F"
MSG_0833 "After the war, Ewan and Amelia set out, as\x01promised, on a trip around the world. Their\x1F\x01deeds along the way made small legends in the\x1F\x01regions they visited. In time, Amelia gave\x01birth to a daughter, and they settled down.\x1F"
MSG_0834 "After the war, Joshua challenged Gerik to a\x1F\x01duel in hopes of pressing him to move to\x01Jehanna. The match ended in a tie, but Gerik\x01was impressed by Joshua's swagger. From that\x01day forward, Gerik never left Joshua's side."

We were just filthy.\x03\x01And we kept droning on about the most\x1F\x01idiotic things: chores, the village\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01But he listened to us intently, and\x1F\x01that fatherly smile never left his face.\x03\x01And he said, \x93You lads are good at\x01driving off dogs with stones\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01Your skills are wasted in the fields. Let's\x1F\x01see how you fare with spears instead.\x94\x03\x0CAnd that's how you were recruited.\x03\x09Exactly. It's difficult to ignore\x1F\x01such a commanding presence.\x1F\x03\x01But\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16the emperor changed.

I studied\x1F\x01chivalry and swore my oaths of fealty.\x03\x01And because of my hard work, the late\x1F\x01King Fado treated me like a second son.\x1F\x03\x01\x16...\x1F\x16It's funny. You and I are from different\x01worlds, but we share the same loyalties.\x03\x09True\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01But King Fado is dead now.\x03\x01And my emperor is the one\x1F\x01who killed him\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01My emperor is as good\x1F\x01as dead to me.\x03\x0C\x16...\x1F\x16I already serve a new lord.\x1F\x03\x01Cormag, you will find a ruler\x1F\x01worthy of your loyalties, too.\x03\x09Yeah, I hope so\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03"

He was a very famous and undeniably\x01skilled archer from abroad.\x1F\x03\x01He was to shoot a tiny target that had\x01been placed in the distance.\x03\x01However, in the middle of the show,\x1F\x01someone stopped him from shooting.\x03\x0COh, no\x16... \x16It wasn't\x1F\x16--\x16\x03\x09Yes, it was young Prince Innes.\x1F\x03\x01He said, \x93That's not far enough!\x01Move the target back farther!\x94\x03\x01Then, he insisted on trying himself.\x03\x0CThat's so like him!\x1F\x03\x09\x17Isn't it?\x1F\x01\x17King Hayden tried to stop him, but\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01Well, you know how he is.\x1F\x01He doesn't listen to anyone.\x03\x01And so, it became a contest between our\x1F\x01prince and this foreign archer.\x1F\x03\x0CSo, what happened?\x03\x09First, they established the ground rules.\x1F\x03\x01Each person was to shoot at the target. If\x01both arrows hit, they increased the range.\x03\x01They simply continued to move the target\x01back until one person missed the mark.\x03\x0CSounds simple enough.\x1F\x03\x09Ah, but the two were evenly matched.\x01Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.\x03\x01The crowd cheered, and the target\x1F\x01moved ever farther back\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01But then it came to the turning point.\x01The foreign archer said, \x1F\x03\x01\x93This is no test. Let's move the\x01target back more.\x94\x03\x01It seemed like bravado, but the archer\x01actually had a clever tactic in mind.\x1F\x03\x0CClever? How so?\x1F\x03\x09They had been shooting for some time,\x1F\x01and the archer's arms had grown weary.\x03\x01Precision archery is far more taxing\x01than the battlefield, you see.\x03\x01So even though he was a skilled archer,\x1F\x01he was at the limits of his endurance.\x03\x01He was still hitting the mark accurately,\x1F\x01but his arm was quivering more and more.\x03\x01Everyone knew that the prince was\x1F\x01on the verge of victory.\x03\x0CI don't understand. They were shooting at\x1F\x01the same target, shot for shot, right?\x03\x01Why would moving the target make any\x01difference?\x1F\x03\x09Yes, they were still shooting at the\x01same target.\x03\x01However, the archer suggested that they\x1F\x01move the target much farther away\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01Much farther than any child Innes's age\x1F\x01could hope to loose an arrow to.\x03\x0COh, that IS clever!\x1F\x03\x09Even the archer, with his trained arms,\x1F\x01was firing at his maximum range.\x03\x01In fact, he almost missed the target!\x1F\x03\x01Then, it was the prince's turn.\x1F\x03\x0CAnd\x1F\x16...?\x16\x03\x09It was clearly too far away for the\x1F\x01young prince to hit the target.\x1F\x03\x01But His Highness was undeterred. He drew\x01his string and fired up into the sky.\x1F\x03\x01The arrow did not merely hit the target.\x01No, it was a perfect bull's-eye!\x03\x01You see, the prince arced his shot\x01to extend his range beyond its limits.\x03\x01To hit a target this way requires\x1F\x01incredible skill, but the prince did it.\x03\x01And then he turned to the archer and said,\x01\x93Shall we move the target back farther?\x94\x03\x01The archer looked so crestfallen. He\x01admitted defeat, and it was settled.\x03\x0CThat's amazing\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x09That it is.\x1F\x03\x0C\x17Thank you very much, Father\x1F\x01Moulder!

Especially breakfast.\x03\x01I've heard that in some cultures, they call\x1F\x01breakfast \x93first break.\x94\x03\x09What's that? What do they break?\x03\x0CA fast.\x1F\x03\x09\x17A fast what? Huh? Speak plainly! I don't\x01understand all this talking in circles.\x1F\x03\x17\x0CWe don't eat anything while we sleep,\x1F\x01so it's as if we are fasting.\x1F\x03\x01So, the meal you eat in the morning\x1F\x01breaks that fast.\x1F\x03\x01This means that breakfast is an \x01especially important meal.\x03\x09\x17Huh. Who would have thunk it?\x1F\x03\x01\x17The only thing I consumed this\x01morning was knowledge!\x03\x0CWhat do you mean?\x1F\x03\x09Just that I make it a point\x1F\x01to learn other disciplines.\x1F\x03\x01You have to if you want to\x01grow as a fighter.\x03\x0CI completely agree.\x1F\x03\x01Young men in this army are strong in \x1F\x01their specific fields, but weak in others.\x03\x01The art of complete training has been\x1F\x01lost on the younger generation, I'm afraid.\x1F\x03\x09Yes, that's right! Back in our day,\x1F\x01fighters had to learn many disciplines\x03\x01in case they had to fill in for a \x01wounded teammate.\x1F\x03\x01I've always wanted to learn archery.\x03\x01The delicate precision is the opposite of\x1F\x01fighting with an axe.\x1F\x03\x0CMe, too. Why don't we meet sometime\x1F\x01and study it together?\x03\x09That's a great idea!\x03"

Nice to meet you.\x03\x01I've been looking for someone around my age.\x01Let's hang out sometime, OK?\x03\x09Sure, but do we have to wait until\x01\x93sometime\x94? How about now?\x03\x0C\x17What are you saying?\x01We're in the middle of a battle!\x03\x17\x09The others are fighting well, so the\x01two of us won't make much difference.\x1F\x03\x01Besides, even though I just started using \x01magic the other day, I'm pretty good.\x1F\x03\x01If something does happen, we'll be OK.\x03\x0C\x17Well, I'm pretty confident in my \x1F\x01skills, too.\x03\x01But, you know--how to put this delicately--\x1F\x01it's the matter of morale. \x1F\x03\x17\x09\x17You certainly are dedicated.\x05\x01\x17That's a surprise.\x03\x0C\x17Hey!\x03\x17\x09Why don't you prove your dedication\x1F\x01by answering this brainteaser?\x03\x0C\x17Like a riddle? Sounds fun!\x03\x17\x09Yes. It'll be really fun to watch you\x1F\x01struggling to come up with an answer. Ha!\x1F\x03\x0C\x17Hey! What's that supposed to mean?\x01Well, whatever. Let's do it.\x03\x17\x09OK, here it is.\x1F\x01Ross, do you know what a balance is?\x03\x0C\x17Of course I do! Who doesn't?\x03\x01It's a type of scale with small plates\x01on both sides to put weights.\x1F\x03\x01When both sides are the same weight,\x01it balances.\x03\x01So that was the riddle? Easy!\x1F\x03\x17\x09Ha ha ha! You're too funny! No, that was \x1F\x01just the setup for the brainteaser.\x1F\x03\x01Here's the real question.\x1F\x01Assume there are 25 pebbles.\x03\x0C\x17Pebbles?\x03\x17\x09Yes, they're really small. As small as peas.\x01They are all the same color and shape.\x03\x01In this group, there's one pebble that's\x01lighter than all the other pebbles.\x1F\x03\x0C\x17And I must tell you the way to \x1F\x01find that pebble?\x1F\x03\x17\x09Of course not. \x1F\x01What kind of challenge is that?\x1F\x03\x01The question is, how many times do you need\x1F\x01to use the balance to find that one rock?\x1F\x03\x0C\x17How many times? Uh\x16...\x1F\x16\x01It's not\x16...\x1F\x1624, is it?\x03\x17\x09What?!\x06\x01\x09\x80\x0B\x09\x80\x0B\x09Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha!\x1F\x01That's the first time I've heard that one!\x03\x01I see. So you were thinking that you'd \x1F\x01measure the pebbles one by one!\x1F\x03\x01That's great, Ross! You're too funny!\x1F\x03\x0C\x17That's not a compliment, is it.\x1F\x01You think I'm an idiot!\x1F\x03\x17\x09That's not true.\x05\x01Actually, it is. Ha ha ha!\x03\x01And did I mention how\x1F\x01perceptive you are, too?\x03\x0C\x17Oh, you! Just you wait! I'll figure it out!\x1F\x01I just need some time to think about it.\x03\x17\x09The anticipation is killing me.\x1F\x03"
MSG_0CC3 "\x09\x10!\x01\x0C\x10\x09\x01\x0CHey, you!\x1F\x03\x17\x09Oh, hi, Ross.\x1F\x03\x0C\x17I have an answer for your brainteaser!\x03\x17\x09You got it, huh? That's amazing!\x03\x0C\x17Y-yeah.\x1F\x01The answer is\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x17\x09Yes, yes?\x1F\x03\x0C\x17Four times!\x1F\x03\x17\x09You must have worked really hard to figure\x01that out!\x1F\x03\x0CSee! See! I told you I'd get it!\x01Fighting's not the only thing I'm good at.\x03\x09However, that's not the correct answer.\x1F\x03\x0C\x80\x0E\x0C\x17What do you mean?\x1F\x01I can't believe it! Ugh!\x03\x01If that's not the right answer, then \x1F\x01what is?\x03\x17\x09You were close. \x01The right answer is three times.\x03\x0C\x17Only three times?\x1F\x01How? Tell me!\x1F\x03\x17\x09The key is how many pebbles you put on the\x01scales at first.\x03\x01First, put eight rocks each on either side \x1F\x01of the scale.\x1F\x03\x01The side with the lighter rock will be\x01higher than the other, right?\x1F\x03\x01Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that\x01the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.\x03\x01So that was one turn on the balance. \x1F\x01The rest is pretty easy to figure out.\x03\x01Let's assume that the lighter rock was\x01in the remaining pile of nine rocks\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01Then you'd put three rocks on each side of\x01the scale. So that's the second turn.\x1F\x03\x01If either side of the scale tips, then\x01the rock is in one of those two piles.\x03\x01If the scale is balanced, then the rock\x1F\x01is one of the remaining three rocks.\x03\x01So, now you've figured out which group\x01of three pebbles has the lighter one.\x1F\x03\x01What you do now is put one rock from this\x1F\x01pile on each side of the scale.\x1F\x03\x01Like before, if the scale tips to one side, \x01the lighter pebble is on the scale.\x1F\x03\x01If the scale is balanced, then the\x01remaining pebble is the lighter one.\x03\x01And that was the last turn on the\x1F\x01scale. Did you get all that?\x03\x0C\x17Huh? Well, I think I got it\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x17\x09What?! I just explained it all very clearly.\x01You still don't get it? That's really\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x0C\x17Really what?!\x1F\x03\x17\x09Um, nothing. Forget it. A ha ha ha ha!\x03\x0C\x17\x93A ha ha ha\x94 what? \x1F\x01What do you mean \x93forget it\x94?\x1F\x03\x17\x09Anyway, it's been fun hanging out.\x01Let's get together again sometime, OK?\x03\x0CIt wasn't fun for me at all!

But I've heard of your fame\x1F\x01from no less a person than my father.\x1F\x03\x01He tells me your name was once known\x01from shore to shore on this continent.\x03\x0C\x17The past is the past. I was just\x01doing what I had to.\x03\x01If I hadn't, I never would have\x1F\x01survived.\x1F\x03\x01But there's something about combat\x01that just doesn't agree with my nature.\x1F\x03\x17\x09If that's the case, why are\x1F\x01you with these mercenaries?\x1F\x03\x0C\x17Ahh\x1F\x16... \x16The answer is so simple,\x01you'll probably laugh.\x03\x01Back when I was a kid, a friend from my\x1F\x01village said he wanted to be a mercenary.\x1F\x03\x01He said he was going to be famous, the\x01greatest warrior in all the land.\x1F\x03\x01No matter how many times I told him to\x01give it up, he wouldn't listen to me.\x1F\x03\x01Well, one day, he left for Jehanna.\x1F\x03\x01I didn't know what else to do, so I went\x01with him and joined the guild, too.\x1F\x03\x01Stupid reason, isn't it? Anyway\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01I didn't particularly like fighting, and\x01while I wasn't opposed to the money,\x03\x01I certainly wasn't in it for fame\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01I just couldn't let my friend go off\x01and get killed.\x1F\x03\x17\x09And where is this friend now?\x1F\x03\x0C\x17He went off and got killed.\x1F\x03\x17\x09I see\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x0C\x17So there was no reason for me to\x01continue being a mercenary\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01But then there were other men who I\x1F\x01considered to be my friends.\x03\x01I couldn't bring myself to abandon them\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x01And so the years passed and here I am.\x03\x01The thing is I can't stand to see my \x1F\x01friends die.\x03\x01But if you're in this business long enough,\x1F\x01people around you get killed. It happens.\x1F\x03\x01The only thing you can do is keep moving\x01forward and try not to think about it.\x03\x01So\x16... \x16Yes, I'd have a problem if you\x01got yourself killed.\x03\x01I've got no place else to go, and I'm tired \x01of trying to forget.\x03\x17\x09Hmph\x16...\x1F\x16\x01Do you really think I'd lose so easily?\x1F\x03\x01It won't do for you to underestimate me.\x03\x0C\x17Oh, uh\x16... \x16Right.\x03\x17"

I am thankful to both\x01my father and you.\x03\x0C\x17That's enough of that.

It was the first\x01time I'd experienced fear as a mercenary.\x1F\x03\x01So this knight saw how scared I was\x1F\x01and said, \x93Go.\x94\x1F\x03\x01He didn't kill me.\x01He let me escape.\x1F\x03\x0C\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x09I was humiliated and ashamed.\x1F\x03\x01My eyes were finally opened to \x1F\x01my own weakness.\x03\x01It goes without saying I lost every\x1F\x01shred of self-confidence.\x1F\x03\x02\x01\x05I still dream about it sometimes.\x1F\x01It wakes me up every time.\x03\x01I've never forgotten that knight.\x1F\x01He thought I was weak and pathetic.\x1F\x03\x0CChief\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x09I was young and stupid.\x1F\x01This scar is my punishment.\x1F\x03\x0CBut that knight\x1F\x01spared your life.\x1F\x03\x01Because of that, good things and\x01better things have happened?\x03\x09What do you mean, Tethys?\x1F\x03\x0CFirst of all, Chief, you're alive.\x03\x01If you had died, all the good times\x1F\x01you've had since that day,\x03\x01and all the joy you're sure to have\x1F\x01from this day onward, wouldn't exist.\x1F\x03\x01And another thing, because you lived, you\x1F\x01made many friends and you met me.\x1F\x03\x01I also don't think that knight thought\x01you were pathetic.\x03\x01I think he saw a young man with his whole\x1F\x01life ahead of him.\x03\x01That's why he let you go.\x1F\x03\x09Tethys\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x0CYep. \x1F\x05I'm sure that's it.

I've never regretted it.\x1F\x03\x17\x09I remember it clearly.

Not very useful at all, really.\x1F\x03\x17\x09Exactly! So I was thinking about coaches\x01that could travel in the air\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x0C\x17What's that?\x03\x02\x01Are you talking about using\x1F\x01pegasus knights?\x03\x17\x09That's what I was thinking at first.

Just think of it:\x03\x01If you knew a storm was coming in advance,\x01you could evacuate everyone in its way.\x1F\x03\x01If you could see what was to come, you\x01could help those who might have died.\x1F\x03\x01Prince Lyon explained this to us with\x1F\x01much joy in his voice and heart.\x03\x01His power would, at long last, be able\x01to help the citizens of Grado.\x03\x09\x16......\x16\x03\x0CWe continued our work. There were\x1F\x01ceremonies, rituals\x1F\x16--\x16such horrors\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01And then we saw it.\x1F\x03\x01In the near future, Grado would be\x01ravaged by catastrophe.\x1F\x03\x09A catastrophe? Do you\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x0CNo, it's not the conflict in which\x01we are currently embroiled.\x1F\x03\x01This event is still in our future.\x03\x01We saw Grado. We saw the earth\x01crumble. We saw our people dying.\x1F\x03\x01We saw the shape our future would take.\x1F\x03\x09What?\x1F\x01That's madness\x16... \x16Idiocy!\x1F\x03\x01I've lived a long life, and I've\x01never heard of anything like that.\x03\x01Not ever.\x1F\x03\x0CI am not surprised that you do not\x01believe me, General.\x03\x01We could not believe it, either. We\x1F\x01tried to disprove what we had seen.\x1F\x03\x01But nothing could shake the vision.\x1F\x03\x01In this disaster, Grado would be\x01destroyed. Countless would die.\x1F\x03\x01Those who died quickly would be\x1F\x01spared the slow horror of starvation.\x1F\x03\x01This was when the emperor died, by the\x01way. Lyon was shattered by despair.\x1F\x03\x01He devoted himself to research, and\x1F\x01then came the Dark Stone\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x09So that's what happened?\x03\x01Is that when the decision\x1F\x01to invade Renais was made?\x03\x0CI don't know.\x1F\x03\x01Only one person knows\x1F\x01the truth behind that.\x03\x09\x16......\x16\x03\x0CI have told you only the\x01truths I have seen.\x1F\x03"

You could\x01see it\x16--\x16he was too kind to survive.\x1F\x03\x01Prince Lyon dreamt of finding happiness\x1F\x01for all of Grado's citizens.\x03\x09\x16......\x16\x03\x0CAnd now, Prince Lyon is no more.\x03\x01I have lost everything.\x1F\x03\x09I have also lost everything.\x03\x01And we have both lost our ways.\x1F\x03\x01We are dead men who have stayed\x1F\x01too long away from our graves.\x03\x01But remember, Knoll\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01You cannot see the future, but you\x01can look back at your past.\x1F\x03\x01Look and learn. And remember.\x1F\x03\x01What gave your life meaning, and what\x1F\x01has taken meaning from you now?\x1F\x03\x0C\x16......\x16\x03\x09If you still hold the convictions that\x01guided you in Grado, you can start anew.\x03\x01That\x16... \x16That is what I must do.\x1F\x03\x01We may be diminished by our shame, but\x01we are not dead yet, my friend.\x1F\x03\x0CGeneral Duessel\x1F\x16...\x1F\x16\x03\x01I am not as strong as you.\x03\x01Still, \x1F\x17I believe you are right.\x01I, too, shall search for a new path.\x03\x02\x01\x17A path that guides me to realizing the\x01dreams Prince Lyon once held so dear.\x1F\x03"
